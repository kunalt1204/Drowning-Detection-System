        1.As the system start you will see two options on display i.e start and setting.<br />
        2.We can select any one of the option by pressing up and down key accordingly and then pressing enter.<br />
        3.If we select start option the system enter into operation mode.<br />
        4.Before enter in operation mode, user must wear the sensor in his hand index finger.<br />
        5.As operation mode start it will initialize for few seconds and then it will display pulse rate (i.e pulse per minute).<br />
        6.While in operation mode there are 2 way of detecting the destress signal.<br />
          a.Manual destress: If user felt any destress, he/she can long (few second) press the help key which will transmits help signal to the receiver which intern set the buzzer.<br />
          b.Automatic destress:This signal is transtted when the pulse being detect fall out of rang  then it will transmits signal to the receiver.<br />
        7.To escape back to menu from any of the destress condition user have press back key.<br />
        8.The second option in the menu is setting which when enter allow user to set heart beat rang.<br />
        9.When entered in setting mode ,it will first allow user to set the lower limit of heart beat rang which is selected by pressing up and down key followed by <br />              enter key.
        10.Once lower limit is entered system will display the setting for the upper limit which is done same as low limit selection.<br />
        11.When upper limit is entered then the system will enter in normal operation mode.<br />
